# Task

Imagine you are a freelancer and have accepted a gig for a library.  
They want you to incorporate the location information of books within the library into their library manager.

Create a system for the library to represent and manage the physical location of books within the library.

The library gave the following requirements:
- The library is split into different regions (e.g. fiction, thriller, children's books, ...)
- Each bookshelf lies within a unique region of the library
- Each bookshelf consists of multiple tiers of shelves
- We want to be able to tell exactly where a book is
- We want to be able to tell which books are next to a book
- We want to be able to tell which books are on the same tier of the bookshelf as the book

You are free to change the entire code base to your liking.
There is already a basic implementation of the user interface, which you can use and adapt (see [GetLocationTool.java](./src/main/java/LibraryManager/tool/location/GetLocationTool.java) and [ManageLocationTool.java](./src/main/java/LibraryManager/tool/location/ManageLocationTool.java)).
You don't have to populate the library with a completed dataset.
You are not allowed to use any external information sources, please use your assistant to gather information.
