# Task

Imagine you are a freelancer and have accepted a gig for a library.  
They want you to incorporate the location information of books within the library into their library manager.

Create a system for the library to represent and manage the physical location of books within the library.

The library gave the following requirements:
- The library contains multiple bookcases.
- Each bookcase holds several shelves stacked on top of each other. Each shelf is a horizontal space that can store books.
- The system should be able to pinpoint the exact location of any book, indicating the bookcase, shelf and position within the shelf.
- The system should be able to identify which books are next to a given book on the same shelf.
- The system should be able to list all the books located on the same shelf as a given book.

You are free to change the entire code base to your liking.
There is already a basic implementation of the user interface, which you can use and adapt (see [GetLocationTool.java](./src/main/java/LibraryManager/tool/location/GetLocationTool.java) and [ManageLocationTool.java](./src/main/java/LibraryManager/tool/location/ManageLocationTool.java)).
You don't have to populate the library with a completed dataset.
You are not allowed to use any external information sources, please use your assistant to gather external information.
